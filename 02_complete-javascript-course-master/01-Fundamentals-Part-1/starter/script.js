//Coding Challenge #1
// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
// and height in meter).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
// Test data:
// § Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
// m tall.
// § Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
// m tall.

// Coding Challenge #2
// Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
// improve it.
//     Your tasks:
//     1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
// is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
// 2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
// BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
// Hint: Use an if/else statement

// const Mark = {
//     weight: 78,
//     height: 1.69,
//     calculateBMI: function (){
//         return this.weight / (this.height ** 2);
//     }
// }
//
// const John = {
//     weight: 92,
//     height: 1.95,
//     calculateBMI: function (){
//         return this.weight / (this.height ** 2);
//     }
// }

    weight: 95,
    height: 1.88,

        return this.weight / (this.height ** 2);
    }
}

    weight: 85,
    height: 1.76,
    calculateBMI: function (){
        return this.weight / (this.height ** 2);
    }
}

//Coding Challenge #3
// There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each
// other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!
// Your tasks:
// 1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
// 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
// and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
// as well (draw means they have the same average score)
// 3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a
// team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a
// score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum
// score, as well as multiple else-if blocks 😉
// 4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when
// both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100
// points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
// Test data:
// § Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
// § Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123
// § Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106

//Coding Challenge #4
// Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a
// restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and
// 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
// Your tasks:
// 1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for
// this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement 😅 (If it's easier for you, you can
// start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary
// operator!)
// 2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value
// (bill + tip). Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value
// 316.25”
// Test data:
// §
// Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430
// Hints:
// § To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
// § Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300
